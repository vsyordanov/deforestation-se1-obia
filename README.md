## üìñ Overview

Deforestation can be defined as the conversion of forest land cover to another type.
In this work, we propose an approach that provides forest loss estimations for short time periods using **Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** imagery.

Key elements of the workflow:

* Mitigation of speckle effect using the **Dry Coefficient** (mean of values under the first quartile, preserving spatial resolution).
* Generation of **forest vs. non-forest** land cover maps via **Object-Based Random Forest Classification** on **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.
* Temporal monitoring, with results demonstrated for the Brazilian Amazon between **2015‚Äì2019** (bi-temporal) and **monthly for 2020**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Open [Google Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
2. Create a new script and copy the content of the `.js` files into your project.
3. Adjust the **study area**, **timeframe**, and **parameters** in the script as needed.
4. Run the script to generate classification maps and forest loss estimates.
